The human brain has evolved for a long time without writing. A person memorized information through concrete images, not abstract ones. Trying to remember a foreign word through spelling, you will quickly forget it, since there is no image, and if there is, then it is abstract. How to remember a foreign word? Break it into syllables and link each syllable to an image, do the same with the translation. Then build a scene from these images. For complete anchoring, place this scene in a familiar place. 
The brain also has to adapt to the construction of images. This will take you three months. I highly recommend reading all books on mnemonics. For example, start with ‘Einstein Walks on the Moon: The Science and Art of Memory’ by Joshua Foer.
